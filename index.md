I am a doctoral student at [ETH Zurich](https://www.ethz.ch/). In my research, I use **probabilistic modelling** and **data analytics** to advance risk assessment for spatially distributed **infrastructure** exposed to **natural hazards**.

Before that, I worked as an infrastructure asset manager for the Swiss Federal Railway ([SBB](https://company.sbb.ch/en/home.html)).

Feel free to check out the summaries of some selected research projects.
