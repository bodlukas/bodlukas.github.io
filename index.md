I am a doctoral student at [ETH Zurich](https://www.ethz.ch/). In my research, I use probabilistic modelling and data analytics to advance risk assessment for spatially distributed systems exposed to natural hazards such as earthquakes. This website provides a brief overview on some selected research projects. 

Before I started my doctoral studies, I worked at the Swiss Federal Railway as an infrastructure asset manager for engineering structures. I was involved in medium- and long-term financial planning of maintenance actions for the portfolio of railway bridges, provided in-house technical consultancy services for projects related to new and existing bridges. 

This website is under development.
