WORK IN PROGRESS

The widespread earthquake damage to the built environment induces severe short- and long-term societal consequences. Better community resilience may be achieved through well-organized recovery. Decisions to organize the recovery process are taken under intense time pressure using limited, and potentially inaccurate, data on the severity and the spatial distribution of building damage. 

In this work, we suggest to encode domain knowledge in ordinal Gaussian process regression to update parts of the regional earthquake risk model using early damage reports from building inspection. The updated model is then used to issue post-earthquake loss estimates with increasing accuracy and precision.

## Workflow for regional earthquake risk analysis

The following contains a simplified summary of the typical workflow for such regional analyses. More detailed descriptions can be found in the excellent book by Baker, Bradley and Stafford [^Baker2021].

The **asset model** assembles the necessary information about the system of interest. In our case this is the building inventory of a specific region. The information pertains to the geographic locations of the individual buildings, their age, and some information on their geometries (such as their height). When information is missing, the asset model specifies how we estimate missing information for the subsequent computations. 

The **source model** consists of the characterization of potential earthquake ruptures that may affect the region of interest. It is typically derived via statistical analyses of historical earthquake events in combination with physical constraints and geodesic measurements. 

The **ground-motion model** predicts the level of ground-shaking at the surface induced by a specific earthquake rupture. Typically, ground-shaking is expressed via intensity measures such as peak ground acceleration. There exist empirical and physics-based ground-motion models that provide probabilistic estimates of such intensity measures at the geographic locations of interest. 

The **fragility model** estimates the building damage as a result of a certain level of ground-shaking. Such models are derived via high-fidelity structural models of archetype buildings, and empirically using damage data from past earthquakes. In the following, we assume that building damage is described via discrete categories (e.g., none, slight, ..., complete), so-called damage states.

The **loss model** computes system-wide losses as a result of the individual component damage states. For buildings, one could model the number of injured persons for each building as a function of its damage state and then compute the total number of injured persons by aggregating over all buildings. Similar computations may be done for direct financial losses (i.e., repair costs). 

## The post-earthquake situation

In the immediate aftermath of an earthquake, it is imperative to use the early-arriving shaking intensity and building damage data as soon as possible to constrain the uncertainty of regional damage estimates and to organize recovery. Below, I explain the inference steps that use the ground motion intensity data measured by seismic networks, and the building damage and typological data obtained by inspection.

The first damage estimates are obtained using a regional risk model, where estimates of ground motion IMs are constrained by seismic recordings, analogous to the current shake map systems. 

Then, data from the first inspected buildings is used to further constrain the shake map and, in parallel, update the building vulnerability function parameters
as well as the typological attribution model.
