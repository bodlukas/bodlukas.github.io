The widespread earthquake damage to the built environment induces severe short- and long-term societal consequences. Better community resilience may be achieved through well-organized recovery. Decisions to organize the recovery process are taken under intense time pressure using limited, and potentially inaccurate, data on the severity and the spatial distribution of building damage. 

There exists a wide range of possible measures and actions to make communities more resilient towards such extreme events. These include the construction of new flood protection systems or increasing the resistance of existing buildings to high wind loads and earthquake-induced ground-shaking. 

Apart from such structural mitigation measures, effective disaster response and recovery is crucial to reduce negative mid- and long-term consequences.
